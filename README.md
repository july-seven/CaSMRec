# CaSMRec
This is the data and code for our paper 'CaSMRec: Causal Substructure-aligned Medication Recommendation'.

## Prerequisites
Make sure your local environment has the following installed:


* `torch = 2.0.1`
* `spacy == 2.1.9`
* `tensorboardx == 2.0`
* `tokenizers == 0.7.0`
* `tokenizers == 0.7.0`
* `numpy == 1.15.1`
* `python == 3.7`
* `transformers == 2.9.1`

## Datasets

We provide the dataset in the [data](data/) folder.

| Data      | Source                                                   | Description                                                  |

| MIMIC-III | [This link](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/) | MIMIC-III is freely-available database from 2001 to 2012, which is associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units |
| MIMIC-IV  | [This link](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/)  | MIMIC-IV is freely-available database between 2008 - 2019, which is associated with 299,712 patients who stayed in critical care units |

Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) for ICD-9-CM is a tool from HCUP.
Next, download the zip package from [web](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/ccs/Single_Level_CCS_2015.zip) and unzip the file ```dx2015.csv``` and ```pr2015.csv```, respectively. 
use the script ```python ICD2CCS.py``` to obtain CCS labels and attach them on corresponding csv files. After the paper is accepted, we will further upload the relevant data preprocessing files.

## Step 1: Data Processing 

* Download the MIMIC-III/MIMIC-IV dataset from [MIMIC-III link](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/) / [MIMIC-IV link](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/1.4/)

* Extract three main files(PROCEDURES_ICD.csv.gz, PRESCRIPTIONS.csv.gz, DIAGNOSES_ICD.csv.gz), and change the path comply with current state:
```
# med_file = '/data/mimic-iii/PRESCRIPTIONS.csv'
# diag_file = '/data/mimic-iii/DIAGNOSES_ICD.csv'
# procedure_file = '/data/mimic-iii/PROCEDURES_ICD.csv'
```
## Step 2: Package Dependency
First, install the [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
Then, create the conda environment through yaml file:

```
conda env create -f mrln_env.yaml
```

## Step 3: run the code
```
python train.py
```
Please run `train.py` to begin training and testing.

On a single NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 3080 Ti (10GB) GPU, a typical run takes 2.5 hours to complete.

## TODO
More training scripts for easy training will be added soon.
